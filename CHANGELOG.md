## Added
* Used the flutter template to create the initial file structure

```
 flet create --template extension --project-name flet-spinkit
 ```

 * Changed all instances of Flet Spinkit or similar to Flet Secure Storage
 * Used references from flet permission handler to modify the structure and code for use
 * Realized flet shared preferences was a better fit and modified the code again
 * Upgraded to flet 0.70.0+ (v1) to utilize the ```flet_extensions.dart``` and ```flet_service.dart```
 * Modeled the calls as closely as I could to the (client_storage calls), to make it easier to use.
